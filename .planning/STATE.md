## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: TUI over desktop/web — Developer tool, terminal-native workflow
- Phase 1: TypeScript + Ink — React patterns, good DX, familiar to many devs
- Phase 1: Git worktrees for isolation — True filesystem isolation
- 01-01: Use conf package for config persistence (XDG-compliant, battle-tested)
- 01-01: ESM module type with NodeNext module resolution
- 01-02: Use synchronous filesystem operations for Jotai's getItem requirement
- 01-02: Store state in ~/.equipe/state/*.json for XDG-adjacent simplicity
- 01-02: Use write-file-atomic for crash-safe persistence
